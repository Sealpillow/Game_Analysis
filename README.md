# Game_Analysis

## Motivation 
[As of 2021, there are over two billion gamers across the world, which is 26% of the worldâ€™s population
In 2020, the gaming industry generated $155 billion in revenue, which is predicted to grow to more than $260 billion by 2025](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/053115/how-video-game-industry-changing.asp ) 
## About
Mini project for SC1015 (Introduction To Data Science And Artificial Intelligence) which aim to predict the games sales using data from [Kaggle Video Games Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset?select=Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv)

## Problem
- Are we able to predict global sales?
- What factors affect global sales for video games?
- In a case with no factors affecting global sales, what can we deduce?
- Which regression model would be best fit to show relationship?

## Model Used
- Linear Regression
- Non-Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression

## Application of Knowledge
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Cleaning DataSet (drop Nan, Remove outliers)
3. Linear Regression
4. Correlations
5. Use of plots(Boxplot, Catplot, Bargraph, heatmap)

## Something new we learn from this project
1. [Obtaining the top 20 Publisher based on count](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46623583/seaborn-countplot-order-categories-by-count)
