# Game_Analysis

## Motivation 
[As of 2021, there are over two billion gamers across the world, which is 26% of the worldâ€™s population
In 2020, the gaming industry generated $155 billion in revenue, which is predicted to grow to more than $260 billion by 2025](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/053115/how-video-game-industry-changing.asp ) 
## About
Mini project for SC1015 (Introduction To Data Science And Artificial Intelligence) which aim to predict the games sales using data from [Kaggle Video Games Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset?select=Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv)

## Problem
- Are we able to predict global sales?
- What factors affect global sales for video games?
- In a case with no factors affecting global sales, what can we deduce?
- Which regression model would be best fit to show relationship?

## Model Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Ridge, Lasso, Elastic

## Steps we took
1. [Cleaning and Restructure](https://github.com/Sealpillow/Game_Analysis/blob/main/NoteBooks/1.%20Cleaning%20and%20Restructure.ipynb)
2. [Data Visual](https://github.com/Sealpillow/Game_Analysis/blob/main/NoteBooks/2.%20Data%20Visual.ipynb)
3. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Sealpillow/Game_Analysis/blob/main/NoteBooks/3.%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
4. [Removing Outliers](https://github.com/Sealpillow/Game_Analysis/blob/main/NoteBooks/4.%20Removing%20Outliers.ipynb)
5. [Linear Regression After Filter](https://github.com/Sealpillow/Game_Analysis/blob/main/NoteBooks/5.%20Linear%20Regression%20After%20Filter.ipynb)
6. [Random forest](https://github.com/Sealpillow/Game_Analysis/blob/main/NoteBooks/8.%20Random%20forest.ipynb)
7. [Ridge, Lasso, Elastic](https://github.com/Sealpillow/Game_Analysis/blob/main/NoteBooks/9.%20Ridge%2C%20Lasso%2C%20Elastic.ipynb)
